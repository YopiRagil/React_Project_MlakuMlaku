# PROJECT REACT MLAKU-MLAKU
## Website: [Mlaku-mlaku](https://mlaku-mlaku.netlify.app)

This repository is created as part of a team project during Alterra Academy Software Engineer bootcamp. We were asked to create a Front-End APIs project using ReactJS with Redux in 2 days. 

The idea of this project is to help user get clothing recommendation based on their holiday destination.

This project uses 3 APIs: 
| No | API |
| --- | -------- |
| 1 | [Amazon Price](https://rapidapi.com/ajmorenodelarosa/api/amazon-price1) |
| 2 | [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/api) |
| 3 | [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/) |

- Andre Novado
- [Derby Prayogo](https://github.com/derbyps)
- [Fazlur Rahman](https://github.com/alulfazlur)
- [Yopi Ragil](https://github.com/YopiRagil)

P.S:
Because we used the free trial for the Amazon Price API, this program will not work unless you subscribe to this API.
